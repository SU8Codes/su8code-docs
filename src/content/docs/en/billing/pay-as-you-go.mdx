title: Pay-as-you-go (balance)
---

Pay-as-you-go means: **top up a balance, and each request charges based on actual usage**.

Good for:
- Irregular usage
- Small-scale trials before committing to a plan

## What you’re paying for

Cost usually tracks:
- **Input length**
- **Output length**

“It cost more than expected” is often caused by:
- Pasting huge code/logs
- Getting longer outputs than intended
- Retries / loops (you thought it was 1 request, but it was N)

## 5 practical ways to reduce cost

1. Ask smaller, more focused questions.
2. Don’t resend the same context if you can cache it.
3. Draft with cheaper/smaller models, finalize with stronger ones.
4. Put a cap on output length when possible.
5. Retry only for 429/5xx and use backoff (1s → 2s → 4s).
