title: Integrations overview (general rules)

In short: **if a tool supports an OpenAI-compatible Base URL + API key, it can usually work with su8 codes**.

You need:
- Base URL: `https://su8.codes/v1`
- API Key: your su8 codes key

## Two common endpoints

- Recommended: `/responses`
- Compatibility: `/chat/completions`

Verify both here:

## Most common pitfalls

1. Missing `/v1` in Base URL → 404
2. Wrong model id → copy from [Models](/en/tools/models/)
3. Tool only supports one endpoint → try `/chat/completions`
