su8 codes is focused on one thing today: a **Codex API gateway**.

Think of us as a stable entry point:
- you call our Base URL with your API key
- we route the request to Codex
- you get the result back

## What we help with

In practice, the hardest parts are often not “writing code”, but:
- unstable networking
- third‑party tools that only support certain endpoints (e.g. `chat/completions`)
- troubleshooting in production

We try to make integration simpler:
- **One stable entry point**: `https://su8.codes/codex/v1`.
- **Tool compatibility**: supports `/responses` and `/chat/completions`.
- **Fast verification**: use the web API tester to get one request working, then integrate.

## Who it’s for

- You mainly use Codex (we’re currently Codex-first)
- You want a professional, stable integration for your team/customers
- You don’t want to spend days on networking and compatibility details

## The two things to remember

- Base URL: `https://su8.codes/codex/v1`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`
