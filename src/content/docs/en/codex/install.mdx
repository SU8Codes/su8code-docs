title: Install Codex (prep)
---

Target outcome: **you have a working Codex client** (CLI or editor extension).

If you can already run `codex` in your terminal, skip to:
- [Configure su8 codes](/en/codex/configure/)

## You can use either

### Option A: Codex CLI
- The `codex` command is available
- You can access the config directory (often `~/.codex/`)

### Option B: Editor extension (e.g. VSCode)
- Extension installed
- You can set Base URL + API Key (or it can read env vars)

> Installation steps vary by version. The key is the next page: point requests to `https://su8.codes/codex/v1`.
