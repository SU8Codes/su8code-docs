This page is only about one thing: **get a first request working fast**.

## Step 1: Create an API key

Create a key in the SU8 Codes dashboard, then store it somewhere safe.

Quick reminders:
- Don’t paste keys into screenshots or git repos
- Copy/paste it into your tool only when needed

## Step 2: Set Base URL + API key in your tool, then verify

You only need two things:
- Base URL: `https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1`
- API key: the key you just created (usually as `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`)

### Verify connection

Paste the key you just created below. A successful JSON response means everything is properly configured and connected.

<ApiTester client:visible />

### 3 common mistakes (avoid these)

1. Missing `/codex/v1` in Base URL → usually 404
2. Putting `/responses` into Base URL → some tools append it again
3. Wrong model id → copy from [Models](/en/tools/models/)

### Next: follow your tool

Start with these (we keep them most up-to-date):
- [Codex configuration](/en/integrations/codex-cli/)
- [OpenClaw integration](/en/integrations/openclaw/)

For other tools that support “custom Base URL + API key”:
