## 401
Usually an invalid key or missing permissions.

Checklist:
1. Ensure you send `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`
2. Ensure the URL is `https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1/...`
3. Regenerate a key in your dashboard and retry

## 404 / model not found
Usually:
- wrong path (missing `/codex/v1`)
- wrong model id

Copy a model name from:
- [Models](/en/tools/models/)

## 429
Rate limit.

Try:
- reduce concurrency
- retry with backoff (1s/2s/4s)
- add jitter if you have loops

## 502 / 504 (Gateway Timeout)
Usually caused by non-streaming requests waiting too long for a response, hitting the mandatory Cloudflare/CDN 100-second idle timeout.

Try:
- **Recommended**: Always enable streaming by setting `"stream": true` in your code! Streaming bypasses the CDN's idle timeout by chunks returning to your user immediately.
- If you absolutely must use non-streaming, try to shorten your prompts or use a faster model.

## 5xx
Temporary server-side issues.

Try:
- retry with backoff
- add timeouts
