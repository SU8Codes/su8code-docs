title: Codex Integration
description: Install and configure Codex CLI, VSCode Extension, or Desktop App
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Whether you are using the **Codex CLI**, the **Official VSCode Extension**, or the **Codex Desktop App**, their underlying configuration files and core mechanics are **identical and fully interoperable**.

You only need to configure the authentication file once, and all three clients will be seamlessly connected!

## Step 1: Install a Client (Choose One)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Codex CLI (Terminal)">
    If you prefer terminal operations, ensure `Node.js` is installed on your machine, then run:
    ```bash
    npm i -g @openai/codex
    ```
    Verify the installation: `codex --version`
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="VSCode Extension">
    Search for `codex` directly in the VSCode extensions marketplace, or visit the official link via your browser:  
    [View in VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Codex App (Desktop)">
    You can download the standalone official desktop application for a full-screen code generation and review experience:  
    [Official Codex App Download](https://developers.openai.com/codex/quickstart?setup=app)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Locate the Configuration Directory

Regardless of whether you are on Windows or macOS/Linux, all three official clients read from the `.codex` directory located in your system's user folder.

Open your terminal or command prompt (CMD) and run the following command to **navigate directly to this directory**:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Run the following in CMD or PowerShell to automatically create (if missing) and open the folder in File Explorer:
    ```bat
    mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\.codex"
    start "" "%USERPROFILE%\.codex"
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS / Linux">
    Run this in your terminal to create and open the folder in Finder:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.codex"
    open "$HOME/.codex"
    ```
    *(For Linux, replace `open` with `xdg-open`)*
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Step 3: Write Configuration Parameters

Inside the `.codex` folder you just opened, create the following two core plain text files (do not add a `.txt` extension):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="📄 config.toml (Endpoint Routing)">
    This file instructs all clients to route their traffic to SU8.Codes:
    ```toml
    model_provider = "su8"
    model = "gpt-5.2"
    # Or replace with any model from the Supported Models list, like gpt-5.3-codex
    network_access = "enabled"
    disable_response_storage = true
    model_verbosity = "high"

    [model_providers.su8]
    name = "su8"
    base_url = "https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1"
    wire_api = "responses"
    requires_openai_auth = true
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="🔑 auth.json (Authentication)">
    This file stores the key you generated in the SU8 dashboard:
    ```json
    {
      "OPENAI_API_KEY": "<Paste_your_sk-xxx_API_Key_from_SU8_Here>"
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> **⚠️ Critical Configuration Note:**
> - **Any changes made to these two files require a complete restart of the client to take effect (reload VSCode, or kill the codex process in the terminal with Ctrl+C and rerun it).**
> - If the VSCode extension throws continuous errors, try running `codex` in the terminal first. This helps determine if the issue is network-related or specific to the IDE.
