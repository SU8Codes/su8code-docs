title: Reconciliation & common misconceptions
---

Goal: **reconcile charges without guessing** — what was sent, how many times, and where extra requests happened.

## 4 common misconceptions

### 1) “I clicked once, why was I charged multiple times?”
Most commonly: **retries**.

### 2) “I didn’t ask for a long answer — why is the output huge?”
Usually the prompt is too open-ended, or there’s no output cap.

### 3) “Is streaming more expensive?”
Streaming is mostly a delivery mode. If it leads to longer outputs, then it can cost more.

### 4) “I used a small model, why does it still cost a lot?”
Huge inputs or repeated retries can dominate cost.

## Quick checklist

1. Pick one request in your dashboard usage logs.
2. Verify endpoint, model, and timestamp.
3. Check retries/loops on your client side.
4. If it still doesn’t add up, collect: request id/time/model/endpoint and contact support.
