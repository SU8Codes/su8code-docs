title: Field reference
---

This page answers one thing: **when a tool asks for fields, what should you put there?**

## One-line rule

- If the tool has **Base URL / Endpoint / API Base**: use `https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1`
- If the tool has **API key / Token**: use your SU8 Codes key
- If the tool has **Model / Model ID**: copy from [Models](/en/tools/models/)

> Watch out: some tools show placeholders without `/v1` (e.g. `https://api.openai.com`).  
> Still use the full `https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1` to avoid 404s.

## Field mapping (plain English)

- **Base URL**: where requests go
- **API key**: your access key
- **Model / Model ID**: which model to use
