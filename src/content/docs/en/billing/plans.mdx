title: Plans (best for Codex-only)
---

Think of a “plan” as: **pay upfront, then get a fixed Codex allowance/benefit for a period (usually monthly)**.

Plans are usually a good fit if:
- You mainly use Codex (and not other providers)
- Your usage is fairly stable
- You want predictable budgeting

## Avoid common mistakes

Before you buy, double-check:
1. **Scope**: is it Codex-only? (Don’t buy the wrong one.)
2. **Validity / renewal**: how it expires or renews.
3. **Overage**: what happens when you run out (some accounts can fall back to pay-as-you-go).

> If you only want plan usage and don’t want extra pay-as-you-go charges, disable any “use balance / fallback” option in your dashboard if available.
