In short: **if your tool lets you set “Base URL + API key”, it can usually work with SU8 Codes**.

## What you need

- Base URL: `https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1`
- API key: a key you created in the dashboard
- Model id: copy from [Models](/en/tools/models/) if you’re unsure

## Start with the two most common paths

- Codex CLI (recommended): follow the config page  
  - [Codex configuration](/en/codex/configure/)
- OpenClaw: a few fields in a config file  
  - [OpenClaw integration](/en/integrations/openclaw/)

## Two common endpoints

- Recommended: `/responses`
- Compatibility: `/chat/completions`

Verify with either:
- [API Tester](/en/tools/api-tester/)
- [First request (curl)](/en/codex/verify/)

## Most common pitfalls

1. Missing `/codex/v1` in Base URL → 404
2. Wrong model id → copy from [Models](/en/tools/models/)
3. Tool only supports one endpoint → try `/chat/completions`
