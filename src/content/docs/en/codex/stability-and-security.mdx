## Stability tips

- Retry with backoff for network/5xx (1s → 2s → 4s)
- Set timeouts (avoid hanging requests)
- Start with low concurrency, then scale up
- Log request ids (if available) for support/debugging

## Security tips

- Never commit API keys into git
- Use environment variables in production
- Do not print keys into logs
