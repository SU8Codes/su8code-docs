SU8 Codes is focused on one thing: a **stable, production-friendly gateway for Codex**.

Think of us as an “enterprise-style” entry point:
- you set **Base URL + API key** in your tool
- we route requests to Codex with stability and compatibility in mind
- you get the result back (and clearer errors when something goes wrong)

## What we help with

In practice, the hardest parts are often not “writing code”, but:
- unstable networking
- third‑party tools that only support certain endpoints (e.g. `chat/completions`)
- troubleshooting in production

We try to make integration simpler:
- **One entry point**: `https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1`.
- **Tool compatibility**: supports `/responses` and `/chat/completions`.
- **Fast verification**: get one request working first, then plug it into your tool.
- **Availability target**: 99.9% (the goal is “fewer surprises” + “faster debugging”).

## Who it’s for

- You mainly use Codex (we’re currently Codex-first)
- You want a professional, stable integration for your team/customers
- You don’t want to spend days on networking and compatibility details

## The two things to remember

- Base URL: `https://www.su8.codes/codex/v1`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`

> If you see a `https://www.su8.codes/...` domain, that’s fine too — just make sure the path includes `/codex/v1`.
